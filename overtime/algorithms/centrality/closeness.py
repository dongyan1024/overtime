def temporal_closeness_centrality(graph, optimality="fastest", labels=None, intervals=None, normalize=True):
    """
        Returns the closeness centralities of nodes in a temporal graph.

        Parameter(s):
        -------------
        graph : TemporalGraph
            A temporal graph.
        optimality : string
            Concept of optimal path in a temporal graph to be used. Can be "fastest" or "shortest".
        labels: list
            A list of node labels. Default is all nodes in input graph.
        intervals : tuple/List
            A tuple of intervals (start & end time pairs). Default is the interval
            the graph is defined over.
            For example: ((0,3), (5,7)).


        Returns:
        --------
        closeness_centrality : dict
            The temporal degrees of the nodes.
            For example: {A: 1.3, B: 1.2, C: 2.5...}

        Example(s):
        -----------
            graph = TemporalGraph('test_network', data=CsvInput('./network.csv'))
            closeness_values = closeness_centrality(graph, optimality="fastest", labels=["A", "B", ...], intervals=((1, 5), (8, 10)))

        Notes:
        ------
        This implementation for calculating temporal closeness centralities utilizes an algorithm for calculating
        fastest path durations outlined in "Path Problems in Temporal Graphs" (Wu et al. 2014), found here:
        https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p721-wu.pdf. Our algorithm takes as input a temporal graph (rather than, say, a
        static expansion) and returns the temporal closeness centrality of all nodes in the graph- that is, the normalized
        sum of reciprocal distances from each node to all other nodes. Temporal closeness centrality can be based on
        multiple notions of optimal path, and as such this algorithm can be executed using either the "shortest" or "fastest"
        notions of optimal path as outlined in BuÃŸ et al. (2020). Normalization is applied as seen in "Temporal Node
        Centrality in Complex Networks" (Kim and Anderson, 2011), found here:
        https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/TemporalCentrality.pdf.

        - Allow user to select optimality
            --> Implement Wu et al. *shortest* paths algorithm
        - Generalize to undirected graphs - currently defined for directed graphs
        - Implement "centrality evolution" (Kim and Andersen, 2011)
        - Test validity on dummy data + debug
        - Test with bigger datasets, e.g. those included in overtime + debug
        - Write unit tests
