def temporal_closeness_centrality(graph, optimality="fastest", labels=None, intervals=None):
    """
        Returns the closeness centralities of nodes in a temporal graph.

        Parameter(s):
        -------------
        graph : TemporalGraph
            An undirected temporal graph.
        optimality : string
            Concept of optimal path in a temporal graph to be used. Can be "fastest" or "shortest".
        labels: list
            A list of node labels. Default is all nodes in input graph.
        intervals : tuple/List
            A tuple of intervals (start & end time pairs). Default is the interval
            the graph is defined over.
            For example: ((0,3), (5,7)).


        Returns:
        --------
        closeness_centrality : dict
            The temporal degrees of the nodes.
            For example: {A: 1.3, B: 1.2, C: 2.5...}

        Example(s):
        -----------
            graph = TemporalGraph('test_network', data=CsvInput('./network.csv'))
            closeness_values = closeness_centrality(graph, optimality="fastest", labels=["A", "B", ...], intervals=((1, 5), (8, 10)))

        Notes:
        ------
        This implementation for calculating fastest temporal path durations utilizes an algorithm for calculating
        fastest path durations outlined in "Path Problems in Temporal Graphs" (Wu et al. 2014), found here:
        https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol7/p721-wu.pdf. Our algorithm takes as input a temporal graph (rather than, say, a
        static expansion) and returns the temporal closeness centrality of all nodes in the graph- that is, the normalized
        sum of reciprocal distances from each node to all other nodes. Temporal closeness centrality can be based on multiple
        notions of optimal path, and as such this algorithm can be executed using either the "shortest" or "fastest"
        notions of optimal path as outlined in BuÃŸ et al. (2020). Normalization is applied as seen in "Temporal Node
        Centrality in Complex Networks" (Kim and Anderson, 2011), found here:
        https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/TemporalCentrality.pdf.
